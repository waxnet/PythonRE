This is an <a href="https://github.com/addi00000/empyrean">Empyrean</a> webhook/config dumper that works by extracting the executable file using
<a href="https://github.com/extremecoders-re/pyinstxtractor">pyinstxtractor</a>. It then imports the extracted config file as a module, enabling
access to the config dictionary without requiring decryption as Python automatically handles the decryption process when importing the file.
